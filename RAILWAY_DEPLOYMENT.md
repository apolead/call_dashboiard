## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Create Railway Account

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Login" and sign in with GitHub
3. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub account

### Step 2: Deploy Your Repository

1. **Click "New Project"** in Railway dashboard
2. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. **Choose your repository**: `apolead/call_dashboiard`
4. **Railway will automatically detect it's a Python app**
5. **Click "Deploy"** - it will start building immediately

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

**IMPORTANT**: Add these environment variables in Railway:

1. **In your Railway project**, click on your service
2. **Go to "Variables" tab**
3. **Add these variables:**

#### Required Variables:
```
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
SECRET_KEY=railway-super-secret-key-2024
```

#### Optional Variables (with defaults):
```
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
DEBUG_MODE=False
COMPANY_NAME=ApoLead
PRIMARY_COLOR=#1e40af
SECONDARY_COLOR=#3b82f6
ACCENT_COLOR=#06b6d4
```

#### AWS S3 Variables (if using S3):
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=combined-client-data
AWS_PREFIX=c_30214/XC_Recordings/
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
ENABLE_S3_SYNC=True
```

### Step 4: Upload Your Data (Important!)

Since Railway doesn't automatically include your local files, you need to upload your CSV data:

**Option A: Include in Repository (Recommended)**
```bash
# In your local project folder
cp data/call_transcriptions.csv ./
git add call_transcriptions.csv
git commit -m "Add existing call data for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

**Option B: Manual Upload via Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Open the deployment logs
3. Use Railway's file manager to upload your CSV

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

1. **Wait for build to complete** (usually 3-5 minutes)
2. **Railway will provide a URL** like: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
3. **Visit your dashboard** - you should see:
   - All your existing data (172+ records)
   - Working charts and analytics
   - Intent sub-category breakdown (3 per row)
   - Disposition filtering
   - All interactive features
